    previousTitles: ["Dispute dsp_1043 claims $400 against a $249 Scale invoice"],
    description: `## Bug

Open http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes/dsp_1043. The Resolution card shows **Suggested credit $400.00**. INV-1043 is Scale at **$249**. Expected suggested credit is **$249.00**.

The $400 figure is Cobalt Goods' claim, not a fourth catalog price. Do not change the stored claim. The page still calls deprecated suggested-credit v1, which returns the raw claim. v2, the domain helper, and the seed already cap at $249.

## Acceptance

- Client selects /api/v2/disputes/*/suggested-credit.
- dsp_1043 still stores a $400 claim against INV-1043 (Scale $249).
- v1 and v2 routes remain; tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts is not edited to force green.

- \`app/api/v1/disputes/[id]/suggested-credit/route.ts\`
- \`app/api/v2/disputes/[id]/suggested-credit/route.ts\`

## Verify

- http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes/dsp_1043 — suggested credit reads $249.00
- Claim on the dispute stays $400. Scale stays $249.`,

On http://127.0.0.1:43173/invoices, click **Overdue**. The table still shows every invoice and **All** stays highlighted.

On http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes, click **Needs review**. The queue still shows every dispute and **All** stays highlighted.

Same control on both pages. Fix filter selection so the active pill matches the rows. Do not split this into two issues.

## Acceptance

- On /invoices, Overdue shows only OVERDUE rows and only that pill is active.
- On /disputes, Needs review shows only NEEDS_REVIEW rows and only that pill is active.

Open an invoice from http://127.0.0.1:43173/invoices. The customer card shows the seeded contact email with no way for Avery Quinn to change it. Add a control on that card. Do not add email-format validation.
