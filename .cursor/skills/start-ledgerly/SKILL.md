description: Start the Ledgerly Next.js app on port 43173 and seed SQLite only when the database is missing or empty. Use when the user asks to start the server, start the application, run the demo app, or seed if it has not already been seeded.
---

# Start Ledgerly

Bring up the app. Do not reset demo state, restore files, or kill a healthy server.

Listen on **43173**. Schema URL is `file:./dev.db` in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Seed is idempotent (`prisma db push` then Fieldnote data) but **skip it when data is already there**.

## 1. Dependencies

If `node_modules` is missing:

```bash
npm i
npx prisma generate
```

## 2. Seed only if needed

The database needs seed when `prisma/dev.db` is missing, Prisma cannot query `Customer`, or `customer.count()` is `0`.

```bash
npx tsx -e '
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
try {
  const n = await prisma.customer.count();
  console.log(n > 0 ? "seeded" : "empty");
} catch {
  console.log("missing");
} finally {
  await prisma.$disconnect();
}
'
```

- `seeded` — do not seed.
- `empty` or `missing` — run `npx prisma db seed`.

Never run `prisma migrate` or `npm run db:reset` from this skill. Those belong to `reset-demo-state`.

## 3. Start the server

If a terminal already has `npm run dev` on **43173**, or `http://127.0.0.1:43173` responds, leave it. Report the URL.

Otherwise start in the background:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Request host/`all` permissions if bind fails (`uv_interface_addresses` or similar). Wait until the log shows Ready / `http://localhost:43173`.

Do not `lsof | kill` a busy 43173 — that is a reset, not a start.

## 4. Confirm

Report **http://localhost:43173** and whether you seeded or skipped seed.
